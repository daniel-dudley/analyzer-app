2022 Senior Design Project @ UC Riverside

This application colorimetrically tests for the urinary concentration of Albumin (Alb). In the presence of bromocresol green (BG), Alb binds to form a green to bluish-green complex. 

Urine is blotted on a microfluidic paper-Based analytical device (Î¼PAD), then placed inside a custom-made enclosure to be photographed by smartphone. The urinary concentraiton of Alb is then determined via RGB analysis using a web-based applicaiton.
