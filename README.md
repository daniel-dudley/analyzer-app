AKI RapID
2022 Senior Design Project @ UC Riverside

This application colorimetrically tests for the urinary concentration of Albumin (Alb). In the presence of bromocresol green (BG), Alb binds to form a green to bluish-green complex. At varying concentrations of urinary Alb, the complex changes color.

To use the device, a user aliquots urine on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD), then places the μPAD inside a custom-made enclosure to be photographed by smartphone. The photo is then uploaded to this application. The urinary concentration of Alb is then determined via RGB analysis, among other image processing techniques.
